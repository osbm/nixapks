# Nixapks

A repository of derivations that builds as much open source android applications as possible.

```
$ nix build --print-out-paths github:osbm/nixapks#smouldering_durtles
/nix/store/z796iq87azckb8nsajpv43g7ybadq47s-smouldering_durtles-1.2.3.apk
```

# Todo

- [ ] After adding 10 different apps (they all can be successfully built) ask to migrate this repo to the nix-community org.
- [x] Add CI that builds all apps on every commit.
- [ ] Add first flutter app.
- [ ] Add first react-native app.
- [ ] Add first ionic app.
- [ ] Add documentation on github pages.
- [ ] Add binary cache
- [ ] Design a proper meta field for the needs of android apps. 
    - [ ] description
    - [ ] license
    - [ ] source
    - [ ] main page
    - [ ] maintainers
    - [ ] minSdkVersion (explain what is this)
    - [ ] targetSdkVersion (explain what is this)
    - [ ] compileSdkVersion (explain what is this)
    - [ ] buildToolsVersion (explain what is this)
    - [ ] abi (list of supported abis: armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64)

## Create checks 

- [ ] Check if the apk can be installed (hopefully on multiple architectures)
- [ ] Check the meta field
- [ ] Check if the output derivation has any runtime dependencies (it should not)
- [ ] Check if the app got an update (maybe from fdroid or github releases) and create a PR automatically.
